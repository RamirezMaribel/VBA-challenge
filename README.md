I wrote two Modules to do this assignment
In the first module, the first summary in columns I-M are created with conditional formatting for highlighting
I found how to se a boolean in the following StackOverflow url: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59461571/how-do-i-keep-initial-value-in-a-for-loop
I found how to format cells values into a percentage from the following StackOverflow url: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6854764/formatting-cells-as-percentage

In the second module, the second summary or variable information is created in columns O-Q that cycles from the first summary that was generated from columns I-M
I found how to have the min and max functions flow through from the StackOverflow url: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42633273/finding-max-of-a-column-in-vba

All urls are also commented out in the exports of the modules attached.
